1. Create a text file named sample.txt with some content.Use redirection to save the contents of sample.txt into another file named backup.txt.

2.1 Create file that contains 1 to 1000 numbers in separated by line.
2.2 Create file that contains 1 to 1000 numbers in separated by space.

3. Execute a ls that generates standard output and redirect it to a file named output.txt.View the contents of output.txt to ensure the redirection was successful.

4.1 Execute a any invalid command that generates an error message and redirect the error output to /dev/null.

5. Execute a command that generates both standard output and standard error, and redirect both to separate files (output.txt for standard output and error.txt for standard error).
View the contents of both files to ensure successful redirection of both output streams.

6. Use a pipe (|) to redirect the output of one command as input to another command. For example, list all files in the current directory and then use a pipe to filter the results to only display .txt files.

7. Create a simple script that accepts input from the user (e.g., their name) and then echoes a greeting. Redirect input from a file containing a predefined name to the script and display the greeting using the predefined name.

8. List all files in the current directory using ls. Pipe the output of ls to grep to filter only .txt files. Redirect the filtered output to a file named text_files.txt.
